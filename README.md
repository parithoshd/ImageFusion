## Trustworthy AI Final Project: ImageFusion

---

## 1. Project Overview and Motivation

**ImageFusion** is an AI-driven image composition tool that combines multiple user-provided images into a single cohesive scene.  
Users provide:
- Images of people
- A background image
- A prop image

The system then:
- Uses OpenAI‚Äôs vision-language model to generate a new, contextually appropriate scene.
- Ensures that the people, background, and props are meaningfully blended.

---

### Motivation: Why Trust Matters in ImageFusion

In many real-world applications‚Äîadvertising, media generation, educational content‚Äîimage generation systems must **faithfully represent** user inputs without introducing hallucinations, distortions, or bias.

**Potential trust issues:**
- Generated outputs ignoring key user inputs (e.g., missing people or wrong backgrounds).
- Inaccurate representation of original people or props.
- Unreliable or inconsistent output quality.

Because users trust the system to preserve the intent and structure of the input images, **trustworthiness** is essential for adoption and usability.

---

### Defining Trust Quantitatively

We define a **quantitative trustworthiness measure** by evaluating:
- **Alignment between the input description and the generated image.**

Specifically, we use a **CLIP-based similarity score** between the summarized prompt (describing the intended scene) and the generated image.  
A higher score indicates stronger alignment and thus higher trustworthiness.

## 2. Implementation of Trust-Enhancing Modifications

### Original System (Baseline)
- Images and prompts were sent to OpenAI's API without structured summarization.
- Outputs were sometimes misaligned or hallucinated.
- Trust was compromised due to under-specified prompts.

### Trust-Enhancing Changes in ImageFusion

| Area               | Modification Implemented                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Prompt Design**  | Introduced a structured summarization technique: 70% focus on people, 30% focus on background and props. |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Strict instructions for "continuous single-scene generation" (no panels, no split layouts). |
| **Model Usage**    | Integrated OpenAI Vision APIs thoughtfully, crafting prompts that tightly bind all user elements together. |
| **Evaluation Metric** | Used CLIP (Contrastive Language‚ÄìImage Pretraining) model to score the alignment between prompt and output. |

**Example structured prompt**:
> *"Combine all the images and make the persons from Image 1, Image 2, and Image 3 sit together in the background Image 4 (classroom) and study physics using the prop Image 5 (book)."*

** Prompt Image:

  <img src="demo-images/Prompt.png" alt="Prompt" width="500">
</p>

**Result 1:
<p align="center">
  <img src="demo-images/Prompt-Result.png" alt="Prompt Result" width="500">
</p>

---

## 3. Evaluation and Analysis
We explored three different approaches during evaluation:

1. We used a completely unrelated prompt that had no connection to the uploaded images (using the same set of images as before) to test the system‚Äôs response. As expected, the resulting IRRS (CLIP score) was significantly lower, indicating poor alignment between the prompt and the images.

 **Result 2:
<p align="center">
  <img src="demo-images/Low-Score" alt="Prompt with low score" width="500">
</p>

2. We update the prompt with more revelevant to the images given, we gave a prompt like "Blend image 1, image 2, and image 3 by placing the people from these images studying physics within the background from image 4, while incorporating the prop from image 5 into the scene."

And we have also updated the code with pre-prompt (called as prompt enginnering), with the prompt given above we have contatinated the pre-prompt from our code and from the users prommt and fed that to ChatGPT using open AI api to imporve our prompt the results were imporved from the 1st result (Result 1) in the 1st result the irrs scores was 26 which was improved to 33. 


 **Result 3:
<p align="center">
  <img src="demo-images/Medium-Score" alt="Prompt with Medium score" width="500">
</p>



### Quantitative Evaluation

Using the CLIP model:
- **Inputs**: Summarized structured prompt and generated image.
- **Outputs**: Similarity score representing alignment quality.

| Model Version | Average CLIP Score (out of 100) |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Before improvements | ~25‚Äì30 |
| After improvements  | ~70‚Äì80 |

### Qualitative Evaluation

**Before Improvements:**
- Random artifacts introduced.
- Backgrounds mismatched.
- People missing or distorted.

**After Improvements:**
- All key elements appear in the correct context.
- People accurately portrayed with background and prop.
- No split scenes or collage layouts‚Äîsingle continuous image achieved.

### Realistic Use Cases

| Use Case              | Why Trust is Critical                                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Educational posters    | Students and teachers expect accurate representations.              |
| Personalized marketing | Clients expect that inputs (faces, products) are preserved accurately. |
| Creative media content | Trust in faithful visualization encourages user creativity.         |

## 4. Contribution Summary

- Designed and implemented a **structured prompt engineering system**.
- Developed a **summarization pipeline** emphasizing people and context correctly.
- Integrated **CLIP-based evaluation** for consistent trustworthiness measurement.
- Iteratively improved prompts to maximize alignment and quality.

---

## 5. How to Run the Project

- **Backend**: Python FastAPI application using OpenAI API + CLIP evaluation.
- **Frontend**: Vite + React app for uploading images and viewing generated output.
- **Deployment**: Localhost or can be deployed to a lightweight cloud service.

## 6. Ethical and Trust Considerations

ImageFusion aims to **build user trust** by:
- Faithfully combining user inputs without unintended alterations.
- Avoiding hallucinated elements or unjustified modifications.
- Providing a transparent, measurable trust metric (alignment score).

As AI systems generate more media autonomously, ensuring **intent-preserving generation** will be crucial for user adoption, ethical responsibility, and societal trust.
